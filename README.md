</p>
<p>This screen should then appear (you may need to scroll all the way up). This is the screen where you will make the appropriate updates after you called the user who created the ticket to get clarifying informtion and as much details as possible. In this scenario you called Melissa, the manager for online banking and did verify that her employees are reporting that customers are unable to access their online banking portal and that the online banking portal is down.</p><br />

</p>
<p>Click on "Normal" next to "Priority:" to change the "Priority Level" to "Emergency" because of a system outage. For the "Optional reason for the update" text box, describe the reason for updating the "Priority Level". Click "Update" to apply the change. Next we need to updat the "SLA Plan:", so click on "Default SLA" to make an update.</p><br />

</p>
<p>This box, sismilar to the previous box, is where we will make the update to the "SLA Plan". Click on "Default SLA" and change it to "Sev-A" due to this being an emergency A-level SLA. Again for the "Optional reason for the update" text field, write the reason for  updating the "SLA Plan". Once again click "Update" to apply the change.</p><br />

</p>
<p>Lastly, click on "Report a Problem" next to "Help Topic:" to change the "Help Topic:" to "Report a Problem / Business Critical Outage". Because it is more specifically a business critical outage if a whole system is out. For "Optional reason for the update" write down the reason for updating the "Help Topic:" and click "Update".</p><br />
